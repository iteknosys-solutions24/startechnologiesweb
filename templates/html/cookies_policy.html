      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how Star Techologies (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
        uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit
        our website at www.startechnologies.com. It explains what these
        technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control
        our use of them.

      <h2>What are cookies ?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
        as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
        cookies are required for technical reasons for our Website to operate,
        and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies.
        Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
        users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties serve
        cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
        purposes.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of cookies we use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong>These cookies are strictly
          necessary to provide you with services available through our Website
          and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong>These cookies
          are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website
          but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies,
          certain functionality may become unavailable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These cookies
          collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us
          understand how our Website is being used or how effective our
          marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make
          advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
          preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that
          ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements
          that are based on your interests.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or decline cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or decline. Essential cookies
        cannot be declined as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to this Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
        for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational,
        legal, or regulatory reasons. Please re-visit this Cookie Policy
        regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
        technologies.
      </p>
